        <h1>Welcome to My Personality Page</h1>
        <p> Here, you will find information on my personality traits, how they influence my life, and insights into my favorite quote and moments.</p>
    </article>

    <main>

        <h2>Impact on School/Academic Life</h2>
        <p>I think my strongest personality trait could be my spontaneity and this no doubt impacts my acedemic life quite alot. Instead of steady motivation drawn from written goals, I am more inclined to random boosts in energy. This does not mean that I am not hard working and strive to do the best in whatever I do but I do often struggle with deadlines because of it. On the other hand, my spontaneity often leads to creative solutions to academic challenges. When faced with a complex problem or a daunting assignment, I'm not afraid to try unconventional approaches or explore uncharted territories of knowledge. This willingness to break from routine and embrace spontaneity has broadened my intellectual horizons and fueled my thirst for learning.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
            <blockquote class="quote">
                "Stop procrastinating." - My Mom
            </blockquote>
            <p>My mother has been the most impactful figure in my life today, my dad would be a close second. I can always count on her to have the advice I need, even if not always wanted and I love her for it. When I was younger, I dont think I appreciated my mom nearly as much as I do now but I have grown to appreciate her loving roughness and almost brutal honesty. I admire her classiness and how she carries herself and although she is still learning herself, she is very much my hero.</p>

        <h2>Personality Assessment</h2>
        <div class="personality-assessment">
            <p>Using an online personality tool, I assessed myself using the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities Test</a>.</p>
            <img class="personality-screenshot" src="../Assets/Personality Screenshot.png" alt="Personality Test Screenshot">
            <p>I believe that personality tests can provide some insights, but they shouldn't be the sole determinant of one's personality. That being said, I enjoyed doing the 16 personalities test. In many ways, it was pretty accurate. As you can see above, I was classified as an adventurer. Adventurers are known for their free form personalities and adaptability. Surprisingly enough, this fits well with my personality trait of being spontaneous. The site also provided insight on problems persons with this personality type have. It said and I quote "...when they need to work on something that’s frustrating or unexciting – well, that can prove something of a challenge." I find this to be very true so although I do not believe in allowing these tests to define who you are and how you behave, sometimes they can prove to be eye - opening and fun.</p>

                <figcaption>My favorite moment - going swimming with my grandmother when she came to visit</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>My life has always been family centered. When I was younger, my grandmother was my neighbour and confidante. I always ran to her arms. Her migrating was one of the saddest moments in my life as a child but it only made her return that much sweeter. </p>

        <details class="hobbies-details">
            <summary>About My Hobbies</summary>
            <p>In addition to my love for technology, I enjoy swimming. My parents placed me in my first swimming club when I was in basic school. Although I dont remember much from that age, I do remember the excitement I felt putting on a bathing suit and modeling it infront of my basic school class. Swimming was my pride and joy and still is.</p>
